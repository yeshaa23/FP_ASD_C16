 * Abstract superclass for all AI players with different strategies.
 * To construct an AI player:
 * 1. Construct an instance (of its subclass) with the game Board
 * 2. Call setSeed() to set the computer's seed
 * 3. Call move() which returns the next move in an int[2] array of {row, col}.
 *
 * The implementation subclasses need to override abstract method move().
 * They shall not modify Cell[][], i.e., no side effect expected.
 * Assume that next move is available, i.e., not game-over yet.
